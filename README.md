# Globant_TAE
This repository was created with the purpose of uploading the information asked by the Globant TAE group. This branch contains a video that shows how to work with continuos integration (CI) using Jenkins. Basically it shows a couple of configurations including maven, java and a Job that pulls a specific repository given by the Globant TAE Group.
